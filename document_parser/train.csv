novel iris segmentation algorithm is employed for limbic and pupillary boundary localization thi model proceeds by iteratively refining the centre and radius of circular iris boundaries in a wa driven by restoring forces of Hooke's Law. Non circular iris boundaries are processed using smoothing spline based edge fitting scheme. Eyelids should be localized from visible iris part usin edge detection followed by curve fitting. This method provides an adaptive threshold for eyelash an shadow detection by analysing the intensity distributions of different iris regions. The isolated iri part extracted from the original eye image is normalized into a rectangular block with constan dimensions to account for imaging inconsistencies. Four levels of encoding is performed using On dimensional Log Gabor filter that extracts and quantizes the unique pattern into a bitwise biometri template. A Hamming distance between two iris templates can be used to recognize the iris image.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"PRUJECLTI 3 Trade Finance Ledger/ Internship Project 40% of the invoices that a large retailer processes currently are not settled immediately (same day). They are settled either in scheduled manner (weekly or monthly) or after a few days. Block chain smart contracts can be used to provide an authoritative, signed and digitized version of an invoice, bill of exchange or a promissory note. This allows one to transfer ownership of the instrument digitally in a transparent and safe manner. Small and medium businesses in the retail supply chain often face liquidity issues. A central authority in the supply chain (like a large retailer) could create such a platform to ease the cost of doing business for its supply chain partners thus ensuring loyalty and improving predictability and quality.
